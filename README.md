# Week 3: Introduction to Git and Github + Python Basics I

This week, we will learn how to use Git and Github, which are powerful tools for collaborative and individual projects. Git is a version control software that aids with tracking changes made to a set of files over time. GitHub is a web-based platform for storing and sharing project files online. You will use GitHub throughout the semester to share your homework assignments with me. Having a GitHub page with evidence of your programming work can serve as a programming portfolio when applying for jobs. 

We will also get started with learning some basic Python commands using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/), an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text.
